# OSIRIS_LinearSlab_Waves
Preliminary OSIRIS (open-source PIC code for kinetic plasma simulations) test code used to study plasma instabilities in a slab profile. 

Electron plasma is configured in a horizontal slab. An external magnetic field is applied in the z-direction (out of the screen). Due to the electric field of the electron plasma, electrons experience E x B drifts. 

This causes radially varying velocities which introduces sheared flows, which evolve into plasma surface waves/instabilities. These Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are similar to diocotron modes observed in cylindrical Penning-Malmberg trapped electron plasma. 

These simulations are an attempt to visualize such surface waves and instabilities. Promising results could support the ultimate goal of simulating diocotron modes in a magnetic dipole confinement geometry.
